# Portfolio Website built using NextJS, Framer-Motion and Tailwind CSS ðŸŒŸ

## About Project

This is a personal portfolio website. This contains a landing page, about me section including skills, experience and education, projects section and a section for mini projects which I enjoyed making. Users are also capable of emailing myself and downloading my current cv. There is also various animated areas in the project and users are able to click links to my github and linkedin accounts. There is also a light or dark option which saves to the local storage. I created this site in order to boost my skills with Nextjs but also as I wanted to showcase some of the work I have accomplished in my studies.  

## Inspiration and Guidance
I have to give a big shout out to CodeBucks video on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw7yWHigGKI) as this was a tutorial from him. I added or changed a few aesthetics but he has provided a really clean and easy to use webpage that I think is very professional. Excellent for what I want to use it for. <br />
